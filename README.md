<h1 align="center">Welcome to Infinite horizontal slider - webperf animated</h1>

> A vanilla javascript like instagram slider focused on webperf without any layout shift (excepted for video when playing but there no way to avoid it).
* To perform animations, I am using rematrix to get current transform style and update throught matrix operations. 
* To perform the DOm manipulation, I used lit-html to duo Shadow DOM manipulations before update DOM elements.
* If a slider contains more than 1000 elements, only visible and near visible are really presents as DOM Elements.
